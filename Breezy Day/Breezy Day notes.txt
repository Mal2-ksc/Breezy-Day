Notes on Breezy Day, by Malaclypse the Younger (mal2fnord@gmail.com)

This is a rompler made from two wind chimes that normally hang in my back yard. The bars are clearly not fine tuned in their natural state, and even in "Tuned Mode" they'll still be a bit rough. All samples are at 48kHz. 

The "Sweep Up" and "Sweep Down" samples have three speeds, all at the same pitches (only the time is stretched). The one in the center of the three is the original, while the outer ones are at a 5:6 and 6:5 ratio to it.

When playing a tuned chime, or an untuned small chime, velocities 0-80 use a soft or mellow sample, 120-127 use a hard or bright sample, and in between the two samples get mixed proportionally. There is no such mixing for the sweeps or the untuned big chimes.

===== LEGAL BULLSHIT =====
•	All rights wronged, all wrongs reversed.
•	The sounds you create are entirely your own. Whether I approve or disapprove or even know about your project is completely irrelevant.
•	I'm not particularly worried about the pictures included with this package. Do what you need to.
•	You may share this VST instrument if you wish, but leave this notice intact. I would prefer that people go to the source to assure the most recent version, but I know this is not always possible.
•	The MIT license applies only to distribution of the Software itself, and individual components that comprise it. There is ABSOLUTELY NO REQUIREMENT to provide credit when merely using the instrument to make sound. You are only required to provide the boilerplate license if distributing the instrument itself or pieces of.
