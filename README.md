# Breezy-Day
A simple wind chimes rompler. Sampled from the actual "instruments" pictured in package, which normally hang in my back yard (but were brought inside for noise reasons when sampling). Plays either at the original sampled pitch, or across a tuned region. Upward and downward sweeps of the small chime tree are included at 3 speeds.

"Cheat sheet" graphic included.
